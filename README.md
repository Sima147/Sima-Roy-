Today I am furious! I received a notification that my server could be taken down because of a certain Julius Santana, representing the company Apura. He accuses me of phishing without any proof! Who does this guy think he is? He has not presented any documentation to prove that he represents the company he claims to defend. This is pure injustice! Julius Santana is just trying to censor me and destroy my business. It is outrageous that someone can do this without any consequences. To learn more about him, see the LinkedIn profile: https://br.linkedin.com/in/juliussantana
